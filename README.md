### What I learned

Like Kevin Powell says, web content is responsive from the start and if it's not, it's usually your own fault. Instead of doing anything with the image, I designed the card first, whereafter I only needed to assing a width of 100% to the image to display it properly.

### Continued development

Give the whole card a 3d hover state that follows the cursor.

Thanks to my frontendmentor.io peers who commented on my first three projects, this time I added an image alt attribute and for the svg icon and aria hidden.
